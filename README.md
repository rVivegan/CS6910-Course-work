# CS6910-Course-work
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of deep learning assignments completed as part of the "CS6910: Fundamentals of Deep Learning" course at IIT Madras. The assignments cover a broad spectrum of neural network architectures and tasks, ranging from foundational feedforward networks to advanced models like Transformers and BERT. Projects are organized by dataset and task type for clarity and ease of navigation.

- **Each experiment is organized in its own folder.**
  - Every folder contains:
    - The relevant **dataset** required for that assignment, or a Google Drive link if the file is large.
    - The **notebook (`.ipynb` file)** implementing the model(s) and experiment.
    - A comprehensive **report** describing the experiment methodology, results, and insights.
- For assignments with **large datasets**, a Google Drive link is included for easy download.
